This analysis evaluates the number of sequencing reads with particular CRISPR guide sequences 
from a number of cell growth conditions (parent library, uninfected, Zika infected). 
The guide sequences are from a commercial library and designed to bind immediately upstream 
of select genes. The CRISPR used is designed not to induce double stranded breaks but rather 
recruit transcription machinery to guide sequence mediated locations. The primary goal of 
this analysis is to identify overrepresented reads in the the Zika infected condition. 
Enrichment of specific guide sequences in the Zika infected condition would suggest that 
those guides lead to an over expression of  downstreams gene and that over-expression 
conferred a survival advantage.
